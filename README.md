# Data for Food

The aim of this project is to collect parisian restaurant reviews on internet and cross them with open data to automatically detect food illness.

For now, the main source used to collect reviews is [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.fr/Restaurants-g187147-Paris_Ile_de_France.html).
